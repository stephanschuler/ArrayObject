# ArrayObject Operator-Stubs

STUBS are normal, syntactically correct PHP files that contain function & class signatures, constant definitions, etc.
Stubs need to include complete [PHPDOC], especially proper `@return` annotations.

IDE needs them for completion, code inspection, type inference, doc popups, etc. Quality of most of this services depend on quality of the stubs (basically their PHPDOC `@annotations`).
